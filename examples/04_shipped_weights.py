"""Ship precomputed weights with ``flopscope.Module``.

flopscope only loads **pickle-free** array weights (`np.load(allow_pickle=False)`),
so you cannot ship a pickled model. ``flopscope.Module`` is the structured way to
author the weights it does support. Subclass it and set your weights as public
array attributes. ``.save(path)`` then writes a plain ``.npz``, and
``.from_file(path)`` reconstructs the object on the grader, with no pickle and
0 FLOPs to load.

Workflow:
  1. Compute the weights offline (free, off the FLOP budget) and ``.save()`` them.
  2. Copy this file to ``estimator.py`` in a folder of its own (folder submissions
     require that exact filename), keep the ``.npz`` beside it, and package the
     folder: ``whest package --estimator .`` (ships ``estimator.py``,
     ``weights.npz``, ``manifest.json``).
  3. Load with ``Weights.from_file(...)`` in ``setup()``. ``context.submission_dir``
     points at your estimator's folder both locally and on the grader.

See docs/how-to/ship-weights.md for the full walkthrough.
