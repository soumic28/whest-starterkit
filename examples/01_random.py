"""Random-baseline estimator.

Demonstrates the canonical contract surface (``setup``, ``predict``, and
``teardown``) and the whestbench RNG-seeding contract:

* ``self._setup_rng = fnp.random.default_rng(ctx.seed)`` inside ``setup`` --
  one-time setup RNG seeded from the grader-supplied ``ctx.seed``. Used for
  random precompute that should be deterministic across MLPs and across
  regrades. This baseline has none, but the scaffold is present so examples
  01-03 all demonstrate the pattern.
* ``rng = fnp.random.default_rng(mlp.seed)`` inside ``predict`` -- per-MLP
  RNG seeded from the grader-supplied ``mlp.seed``. This is the seed
  whose determinism the grader checks under regrade. Submissions that
  use their own per-MLP seeds (or unseeded randomness) may be
  disqualified. See ``docs/reference/estimator-contract.md``
  ("Reproducibility under the grader seed") for the contract.
