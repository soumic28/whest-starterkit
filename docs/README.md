# Documentation

The starter kit teaches you to write a Python estimator that predicts
per-neuron mean activations of a randomly-initialized ReLU MLP under a
FLOP budget. **Score = `final_layer_mse × max(0.1, C_m/B_m)`; lower is better**:
accuracy on the last layer, times the budget fraction you spent, floored at
10%. If you are new, read the [60-second
overview](../README.md#-60-second-overview) in the root README first, then
use the map below.

## 🧭 Reading paths

Pick the line that matches your situation.

### "I just cloned the kit."

[Stage 1](getting-started/stage-1-standalone.md) → skim [scoring-model](concepts/scoring-model.md) so you know what's being measured → [Stage 2](getting-started/stage-2-validate.md) → [write-an-estimator](how-to/write-an-estimator.md) → [Stage 3](getting-started/stage-3-run-local.md).

### "I have a working estimator. I want a better score."

[algorithm-ideas](how-to/algorithm-ideas.md) → [code-patterns](reference/code-patterns.md) (the ReLU expectation and where it breaks) → [manage-flop-budget](how-to/manage-flop-budget.md) (the FLOP walkthrough table, `whest run --profile`).

### "My score regressed after a change."

[debugging-checklist](how-to/debugging-checklist.md) → [common-participant-errors](troubleshooting/common-participant-errors.md) → [FAQ: local vs remote score mismatch](troubleshooting/faq.md#my-local-score-is-great-but-my-submission-scores-10x-worse--why) → [whest-doctor](reference/whest-doctor.md).

### "The numbers I'm reading don't match the numbers I'm getting."

[rounds](reference/rounds.md) (which round's rules apply to you, and why a pre-Phase-2 number doesn't compare) → [scoring-model](concepts/scoring-model.md) → [score-report-fields](reference/score-report-fields.md).

### "I'm about to submit."

[pre-submission-checklist](how-to/pre-submission-checklist.md) → [Stage 5](getting-started/stage-5-package.md) → [score-report-fields](reference/score-report-fields.md) (so you can read the leaderboard report).

Figures are raw `final_layer_mse` on the `mini` split; the ranked score is this ×
`max(0.1, C/B)`, which for every bundled example is the 0.1 floor. See
[concepts/scoring-model.md](concepts/scoring-model.md#example-estimator-benchmarks).
