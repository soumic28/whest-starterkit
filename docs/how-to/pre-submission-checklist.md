# Pre-submission checklist

> [← Documentation](../README.md)

## 🎯 When to use this page

Use this page in the minutes before you click "submit" on AIcrowd. Run through
these checks; each one maps to a single command or a one-line confirmation.

> **You get 10 submissions per team per UTC day.** The counter resets at
> 00:00 UTC and unused slots do not roll over, so every submission that fails
> on something mechanical costs you a tenth of the day. Each check below takes
> less time than a wasted slot.

## Correctness

- [ ] **`uv run whest validate --estimator estimator.py`** — read the
      **Checks table**, not only the panel header. Every row must say `OK`. A
      `FAIL` on `setup(context) within the graded cap` still prints
      `Status: success` and still exits `0`, so a green panel alone is not
      proof. `--json` is not a substitute: it emits `{"ok": true, …}` with no
      check rows at all. (Catches: wrong shape, non-finite values, a `setup()`
      that raises; in the table only, a `setup()` over the 5 s cap.)
- [ ] **`uv run whest run --estimator estimator.py --runner local --seed 42 --n-mlps 3`**
      produces an `adjusted_final_layer_score` you recognize.
- [ ] **`uv run whest run --estimator estimator.py --runner subprocess --seed 42 --n-mlps 3`**
      produces a score within ~1% of the local-runner score above.
      (Catches: shared global state, RNG re-seed differences, imports
      that fail in clean processes; see [FAQ](../troubleshooting/faq.md#my-local-score-is-great-but-my-submission-scores-10x-worse--why).)

## Budget hygiene

- [ ] In the run report, **`per_mlp[i].budget_exhausted` is `false`** for
      every MLP. Any `true` means that MLP scored against zeros.
- [ ] **`flops_used`** is comfortably under `flop_budget`. That leaves headroom
      for the harder MLPs in the grader suite. The per-MLP budget is
      `B_m = 2,199,023,255,552` FLOPs (2^41), and what it caps is
      `C_m = F_m`: your analytical FLOP count, nothing else.
- [ ] **`residual_wall_time_s` stays under 0.4 s on every MLP.** Residual
      wall time does not contribute to your score; it is capped. Spend more than
      **400 ms** outside flopscope ops on one MLP and that MLP's prediction
      is replaced with zeros. The residual exists for plumbing (loops,
      control flow, bookkeeping), not for computation, and doing meaningful
      compute there is disqualifiable rather than merely expensive.
      Reproduce the cap locally with `--residual-wall-time-limit 0.4` and
      confirm **`residual_wall_time_exhausted` is `false`**. If you believe
      a legitimate estimator cannot fit the cap, write to
      [arc-whestbench@aicrowd.com](mailto:arc-whestbench@aicrowd.com) rather than submitting without checking.
- [ ] **`per_mlp[i].time_exhausted` is `false`.** The grader allows **120 s
      of wall time per MLP**; confirm the value you were scored under in
      `run_config.wall_time_limit_s` in your own run report rather than
      assuming it. Re-run with `--max-threads 1` as a stress test: on the
      grader your solution process gets **2 pinned vCPUs** (the flopscope
      backend has its own 14), and the rules guarantee no particular
      evaluation hardware, so work that finishes in time locally only
      because it is spread across your laptop's cores can exceed the cap on
      the grader. See
      [Is scoring hardware-dependent?](../troubleshooting/faq.md#is-scoring-hardware-dependent).
- [ ] **You fit in 8 GB.** That is the whole solution process, and width 1024
      makes it a real constraint: one full covariance matrix is 1024×1024,
      sixteen times the elements of the Phase 1 256×256. If you keep a
      per-layer covariance, count the layers before you ship.
- [ ] **No internal deadline calibrated to your own machine's clock.** If
      your estimator bails out on `time.time()` and returns a fallback, a
      slower grading machine can trigger that path silently. You get a
      valid-looking score computed from the degraded answer, with no error
      to tell you. Prefer a budget-based cutoff.

## Allowed code

Phase 2 states this as a rule, not as a limitation of the sandbox: a
submission may use the **flopscope client API** and the **pure-Python
standard library**, and nothing else. Breaching it is disqualifiable, not
merely broken, and review continues after grading, so a submission that
does not conform is invalidated once identified. Read the list once even if your
estimator is fifty lines of `fnp`; the full rule is in
[Allowed Code](../concepts/allowed-code.md).

- [ ] **No vendored array or math libraries.** Shipping `numpy`, `scipy`, a
      BLAS build, or any part of one inside your submission folder is
      prohibited, and so is any compiled kernel: `.so`, `.dylib`, `.pyd`, a
      built extension module, generated machine code.
- [ ] **No FFI.** `ctypes`, `cffi`, and any other route out of the
      interpreter are prohibited.
- [ ] **No concurrency.** `asyncio`, `threading`, `subprocess`, and
      `multiprocessing` are prohibited, including the "only to overlap I/O"
      uses.
- [ ] **No compute while a flopscope op is in flight.** Doing your own work
      alongside an in-flight flopscope call is prohibited; it is the same
      offence as computing in the residual, and it is disqualifiable.
- [ ] **Do not modify the accounting.** Do not patch, wrap, replace, or
      otherwise reach into the flopscope client, its transport, or its FLOP
      accounting.
- [ ] **Data files are still allowed.** Weights, lookup tables, and
      precomputed artifacts are explicitly permitted, and with `C_m = F_m`
      they are the cheapest thing you can ship; see
      [ship-weights.md](./ship-weights.md), which also covers the boundary
      between data and code.
- [ ] **Only sandbox-available imports.** The sandbox enforces the rule from
      the other side: your estimator can import **only** `flopscope` (incl.
      `flopscope.numpy as fnp`), the `whestbench` API (`BaseEstimator`,
      `MLP`, `SetupContext`), and the standard library. There is no
      `requirements.txt` install. Your local venv *has* the rest, so a local
      run won't flag a stray `import`; grep your estimator and route all
      array math through `flopscope.numpy as fnp`. Heavier work (a
      PyTorch-trained model, a scipy routine) goes **offline** → ship a
      pickle-free `.npz`, loaded in `setup()`.

Unsure whether a technique you have in mind is allowed? Ask
[arc-whestbench@aicrowd.com](mailto:arc-whestbench@aicrowd.com) before you build on it.

## Reproducibility

- [ ] No filesystem reads from outside `SetupContext.submission_dir` (your shipped files) and `SetupContext.scratch_dir`. The
      grader can't see your laptop.
- [ ] No network calls in `setup()` or `predict()`. The grader has no
      outbound network.
- [ ] No time-based seeds (`time.time()`, `os.urandom`, …) and no
      participant-chosen seeds. If your estimator uses randomness inside
      `predict()`, seed it from `mlp.seed`:
      `fnp.random.default_rng(mlp.seed)`. If your estimator uses randomness
      inside `setup()` (for example, a fixed random projection basis), seed it from
      `ctx.seed`: `fnp.random.default_rng(ctx.seed)`. Custom seeds at either
      site may be disqualified for prize eligibility; see
      [Estimator Contract: Reproducibility](../reference/estimator-contract.md#reproducibility-under-the-grader-seed).
      Do **not** call `fnp.random.seed(...)`; use `default_rng(...)` for an
      isolated `Generator`.

## Sanity

- [ ] `predict()` returns the **post-ReLU** mean for **every** layer,
      shape `(mlp.depth, mlp.width)`, `(16, 1024)` at the Phase 2 shape.
      Off-by-one (returning depth+1 or depth-1 layers) is the most common
      silent bug, and a hard-coded `(32, 256)` left over from Phase 1 is the
      second.
- [ ] If you ship a `setup()`: it's idempotent and stays well under the
      grader's hard **5 s** setup budget. `setup()` runs once per worker
      process (roughly **5-15 times** per submission, not once), and each run
      gets its own 5 s, so anything expensive is paid for again on every
      worker. Overrunning it fails the whole submission with `SETUP_TIMEOUT`:
      not one MLP, all 100. Confirm the cap you ran under in
      `run_config.setup_timeout_s` (it reads `5.0`), and rehearse a tighter one
      with `--setup-timeout 2.5` to see your headroom; over the cap you get
      `Error [setup:SETUP_TIMEOUT]: setup exceeded timeout (…)`. Heavy
      precompute belongs offline: ship the artifact next to your estimator and
      load it (see [how-to/ship-weights.md](./ship-weights.md)).
- [ ] No `print()` left in `predict()`. The grader runs many MLPs;
      stdout flooding consumes `residual_wall_time_s`.

## Final command

Once every box above is checked, ship it (run `whest login` first if you
haven't):

```bash
uv run whest submit --estimator estimator.py --watch
```

`whest submit` packages, uploads, and creates the submission in one step.
Prefer to inspect the artifact first? Build it with
`uv run whest package --estimator estimator.py --output submission.tar.gz`, check
`tar tf submission.tar.gz` (it should contain `estimator.py` and `manifest.json`),
then `uv run whest submit submission.tar.gz`.

Shipping weights or extra modules? Package the **folder** instead
(`uv run whest package --estimator . --output submission.tar.gz`). It lists every
file and asks you to confirm, and credential files like `.env` are never
included. See [Ship Weights](./ship-weights.md).

That command spends one of your **10 slots for the UTC day**. If two of you
are iterating on the same team, agree who is spending them before you both
press submit.
